# Week 10 Lab Report

## Finding the bug:
* First I used ```cp``` to copy ```test-files``` and ```script.sh``` into my ```markdown-parse```.
* For both my ```markdown-parse``` as well as the provided, I used 
```
bash script.sh > results.txt
```
to create the ```results.txt``` files needed to do the comparison.

I used ```diff``` on the two files to find discrepancies between the expected and actual outputs.
