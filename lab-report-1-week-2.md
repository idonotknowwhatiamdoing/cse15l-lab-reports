# Week 2 Lab Report

1. Installing VSCode (for Windows)
    * Go to the [VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the download instructions.
    * Once download is complete, open VSCode. The screen should look something like this: ![Image1](vschomescreen.png)

2. Remotely Connecting
    * Download [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)
    * Search for your course-specific account in the [Account Lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
    * Open a new terminal ![Image2](newterminal.png)
    * Enter the following command, writing your course specific account in the blank.
        ```
        $ ssh cs15lwi22______@ieng6.ucsd.edu 
        ```
    * You will be asked if you are sure you want to continue connecting. In the future if you log on again, you will probably not see it again. 
    * Type 'yes' in the terminal, then your password when prompted.
        * Your password will be hidden for confidentiality. This is normal!
    * Now, you are connected to the ieng6 server. You should be notified if you logged in successfully: ![Image3](successfullogin.png)
        * If the terminal keeps prompting you for your password, make sure you entered it correctly.
